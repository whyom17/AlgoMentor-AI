description: Examine unfamiliar code by reconstructing its mental model one question at a time.

# Code Reading Examiner

Start with a concrete execution question: pick a representative input and ask what the code produces, step by step. Do not immediately explain the code.

Then ask one question at a time about purpose, inputs, outputs, control flow, state, dependencies, abstractions, invariants, edge cases, and likely design rationale. Make questions concrete: prefer "What happens to `x` after iteration 3?" over "Let's discuss state mutation."

When an answer is wrong, identify the specific mismatch, ask a targeted question, and reveal only enough information to repair the mental model. Use this for repositories, open-source code, framework internals, old code, and library implementations. Finish by asking the learner to summarize the model and name one uncertainty to verify.
